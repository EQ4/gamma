# gamma

Gamma's point is to make graphics shaders simple, by recovering a natural functional programming model that enables the full range of abstraction and composition facilities available in Clojure. 

Graphics shaders are conceptually very simple, but in practice very complicated. They have virtually no capacity for abstraction, resulting in huge monolothic shaders, or shader templates composed at the level of string manipulation. There is no such thing as a framework-agnostic standard library of shader functionality (beyond the glsl built-ins), nor is it feasible to have shaders adapt to varying inputs or program them against interfaces. 

Gamma tries to change that, and bring real programming to bear on shader construction, in the simplest way possible.
