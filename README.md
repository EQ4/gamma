# gamma

Gamma is a simple, composable API for describing WebGL shaders. 

Gamma's purpose is to be a fundamental building block for graphics libraries. It makes it easy to define your own abstractions that compile down to GLSL shaders. It also makes it possible for graphics libraries to meet at a common standard and achieve interoperability. 

Read the [rationale](https://github.com/kovasb/gamma/wiki/Gamma-Rationale).

# API

Gamma lets you do two things: A) construct a GLSL AST as clojure data, and B) compile it to a GLSL program string

The value of Gamma is that it lets you use Clojure to abstract the process in step A. You can use functions, procotols, multimethods, datastructures, etc to abstract the GLSL. Your Clojure program runs, and the GLSL AST is produced. Gamma does NOT try to tanspile Clojure to GLSL.


## Constructing GLSL 

Gamma represents the GLSL AST as Clojure maps.  The functions in gamma.api are convenience functions for constructing the maps:

```clojure
(require '[gamma.api :as g])
```

```clojure
(g/sin 1)
=>
{:tag :term, :head :sin, :id {:tag :id, :id 1}, :type :float,
  :body ({:tag :term, :head :literal, :value 1, :type :float, :id {:tag :id, :id 2}})}
```

Each GLSL operator, function, or type constructor has an equivalent function in gamma.api. 

The different species of GLSL input/output variables also have constructors:

```clojure
;; attribute 
(g/attribute "a_Attr" :float)
;; uniform 
(g/uniform "u_Uniform" :mat4)
;; varying 
(g/varying "v_Varying" :float :highp)
```

To refer to a input variable with the AST, simply create it and pass it to an AST constuctor: 

```clojure 
(g/sin (g/attribute "a_Attr" :float))
```

In Gamma, we represent if-statements as expressions, so we can nest if's inside of other expressions:

```clojure 
(g/sin (g/if (g/attribute "b_Bool" :bool) 1 2))
```

Gamma allows you to employ vanilla Clojure programming to build up the ASTs.

Insert arbitary helper functions to construct pieces of the tree:

```clojure
;; start with 
(g/+ 1 (g/+ 2 3))

;; create helper
(defn my-helper [x] (g/+ x 3))

;; refactor tree using helper:
(g/+ 1 (my-helper 2))
```

To reuse an expression in multiple places, use let, or any other binding form:
```clojure
(let [x (g/length (g/attribute "a_Vec4" :vec4))]
  (g/vec3 x x x))
  
;; equivalent to 
(g/vec3 
    (g/length (g/attribute "a_Vec4" :vec4))
    (g/length (g/attribute "a_Vec4" :vec4))
    (g/length (g/attribute "a_Vec4" :vec4)))
```

Gamma's compiler will ensure that the (g/length ...) expression will only be evaluated once. This frees you from having to think about intermediary variables within the AST and their impact on performance. 

The Gamma AST is simple data and composes cleanly. Most things you can imagine doing will just work. 

```clojure
;; Some higher-order AST construction

(reduce g/+ 0 [1 2 3 4])

(apply g/vec4 (map #(g/clamp % 0 1) [0 0.5 1 2]))
```

You can pass around AST fragments however you want, including inside datastructure:

```clojure

(def x {:color (g/vec3 0 0 1) :alpha 0.5})

(defn conj-alpha [c]
  (g/vec4 (:color c) (:alpha c)))
  
(conj-alpha x)  
```

If this looks like very basic programming, its because it is. However, these forms of abstraction are unavailable in raw GLSL, or in many of the languages and tools dedicated to wrapping it. 


### Differences from GLSL

#### No binding forms 

You don't create bindings or assignments within the AST.

If you want to pass an expression to multiple places, just do with Clojure:

```clojure
(defn my-abs [a b]
  (let [x (g/+ a b)]
    (g/if (g/< 0 x)
       (g/* -1 x) 
       x)))
```

#### Statements are expressions

Unlike ordinary GLSL, Gamma's AST is expression oriented. 

In particular, if-statements are expressions that can be nested in other expressions.

```clojure
(g/+ 1 (g/if conditional-expr 2 3))
```


This duplicates the (g/+ a b) AST fragment in multiple places, but Gamma's compiler will optimize that duplication away.

#### No for loops 

WebGL only supports for loops that are un-rollable. You can unroll these yourself trivially with higher-order functions.

For example, map a function across each element of a GLSL vector and produce a new GLSL vector:

```clojure
(defn map-over-vec4 [f v]
 (apply g/vec4 (for [i (range 4)] (f (g/part v i)))))
```
